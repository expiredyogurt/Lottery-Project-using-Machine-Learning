# Lottery-Random-Forest
Try to predict the lottery using various machine learning model such as LSTM, XGBoost, Deep Learning, Neural Network, and Random Forest.

sh file is used to run all the python scripts sequentially. 
There is also a python file to pull the winning numbers from the website and append it to the CSV file for future training of the model. 

Data was trained in 20+ years of lottery past results although it is not recommended to go that far back as the machine or drawing method has changed over the years.
